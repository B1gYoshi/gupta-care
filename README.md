# A Gupta Healthcare Enterprises Product
We have chosen to complete the Healthcare Management System project with the intention of creating a resource for patients and clinicians that improves accessibility for healthcare services and enhances record management. The importance of this system extends across the world since healthcare is relevant everywhere and could be used by patients and clinicians everywhere. With the implementation of this system, we can eliminate the use of manual records by ensuring all patient information is kept accurately by our system. Accurate record keeping also aids the issue of miscommunication as written records may be misinterpreted or recorded inaccurately. Compared to manual records, we can update electronic records more easily and efficiently.
